description: 'Here at BaseHealth, we imagine a future where no individual falls through
  the cracks of our healthcare system. A future where no healthcare provider is blindsided
  by the development of a new disease. A future where uncovering the unknown risk
  within new populations is both a routine and crucial exercise ahead of activities
  as diverse as resource planning, benefits development, and care management. The
  BaseHealth analytic engine is the foundation upon which all this can be accomplished. '

excerpt: 'Healthcare is rife with new technologies, but what BaseHealth is doing is
  different. In fact, Redox, a fellow startup in the space working on interoperability
  issues, recognized BaseHealth as one of 70 companies driving the future of healthcare
  technology. '
