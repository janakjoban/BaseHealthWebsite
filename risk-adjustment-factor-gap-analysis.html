      What is Predictive RAF?
    </h3>
    <p class="p__alt">
BaseHealth’s Predictive RAF Analytics prospectively anticipates RAF score adjustment opportunity and revenue potential in MA populations for the upcoming year, and speculatively identifies the actual members who should be targeted for diagnostics and therapeutic intervention. 
<br />
Our comprehensive precision insights platform bridges Big Data, population-level analytics with Small Data, member-level analytics to provide targeted, actionable interventions that accelerate RAF revenue, optimize clinical effectives and increase ROI.

      Why is Predictive RAF important?
    </h3>
    <p class="p__alt">
To be successful in Medicare Advantage (MA) claims revenue recovery, it’s essential for healthcare providers to capture all of the revenue owed based on the risk of enrolled MA populations. While CMS allows for adjustment of RAF score and payments, most MA plans and health systems rely largely on retrospective capture of diagnosis, potentially missing out on claims for high-risk members that would warrant increased payments.  
<br />
Our Predictive RAF Analytics uses science and evidence-based methodologies to provide clinical guidance to healthcare practitioners and help them to prepare today for what is likely to happen in the future. Better anticipation of patient needs and treatment plans ultimately benefit the patients’ well-being as much as healthcare systems’ financial success.

      How does Predictive RAF add value? 
    </h3>
    <p class="p__alt">
      BaseHealth’s data shows early prediction of Medicare Advantage members at risk of high RAF scores will help health systems to INCREASE REVENUE and IMPROVE QUALITY OF CARE. 
<br />
The clinical guidance BaseHealth’s analytics provides healthcare practitioners helps them to prepare today for what is likely to happen in the future, allowing for better anticipation of patient needs and treatment plans. Ultimately the patients benefit as much as the healthcare providers.
