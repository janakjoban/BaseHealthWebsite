            For genotyping, you will be instructed to send your saliva sample to
            our third-party Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)
            certified laboratory ("Laboratory"). The sample will be labeled with
            the unique barcode and no other identifier. The unique barcode identifies
            you to us but not to the laboratory. We are also required to provide
            sex and date of birth or age to the laboratory pursuant to CLIA
            requirements. No other Personal Information is required for the analysis.
            To protect your privacy, receiving personnel at the laboratory will
            remove and discard any identifying information (e.g. name, address)
            included with saliva samples before testing personnel receives the
            samples for genotyping. Receiving personnel do not perform testing,
            and testing personnel only handle samples labeled with the unique
            barcode. DNA and saliva samples are destroyed after the laboratory
            completes its work, provided that laboratory legal and regulatory
            requirements no longer require the actual samples to be maintained.
            The laboratory securely sends the resulting Genetic Data to us along
            with your unique barcode. Genetic Data is encrypted and stored securely;
            the laboratory also stores your Genetic Data, but labeled only with
            a sample barcode. The laboratory conducting DNA extraction and
            analysis does not have access to your name, other Enrollment
            Information, or any other Personal Information except your sex and
            date of birth or age, as required by CLIA.

            Laboratory of Illumina, Inc., your physician will write the required
            prescription for your blood draw and arrangements will be made with
            you to have a sample of your blood drawn and submitted to the Laboratory
            for analysis. Your name, date of birth, sex, and ethnicity will be
            submitted with your physician's prescription. The Laboratory requires
            an additional written Patient Informed Consent Form be completed and
            payment information be provided and submitted along with your sample
            before analysis. Your blood sample will be analyzed for multiple
            parameters, including genetic testing. Your blood sample will be
            disposed by the Laboratory following completion of such testing and
            the analysis will be sent to BaseHealth or your Physician to be
            uploaded to your Genophen account. Additional information may be

          We may also employ software technology known as "web beacons" or "clear
          GIFs" which helps us keep track of what content on our Website is
          effective. Web beacons are small graphics with a unique identifier that
          are used to track the online movements of Internet users. Web beacons
          are embedded in the web pages you review, so they are not stored on
          your hard drive. The web beacons we use do not track or collect any
          personally information about you and they are in no way linked to your
          personally identifiable information except when you log-in to your
          Genophen account and then as to your last name, first name, and sex.
