[BaseHealth](http://www.basehealth.com/), the creator of the first predictive, evidence-based, and data-driven population health management solution, today announced that it has received an overall investment of $8.5 million, including $2.5 million from lead investor [HBM Healthcare Investments](http://www.basehealth.com/posts/www.hbmhealthcare.com/en/unternehmen/profil.php) (SIX HBMN), a listed healthcare investment company with net assets over $1 billion.

The investment will be used to further develop BaseHealth’s analytics engine, which is based on peer-reviewed medical literature, curated by physicians and scientists, and enhanced with laboratory, biometric, social, family history and behavioral data. BaseHealth supplements this with retrospective claims and ICD data. The data is then passed through the analytics engine, which uses machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to assess patient risk for 43 possible disease threats.

BaseHealth’s approach to population health and value-based care enables healthcare professionals to improve care and reduce the per capita cost of healthcare by identifying the rising unknown risk within their patient population, so they can intervene to both prevent diseases before they start and control them before it’s too late. The “[Invisible Patient](https://medium.com/@basehealth/finding-the-invisible-patient-21c19e384cdc)" is how BaseHealth refers to these individuals. With the right medical intervention at the right time, their healthcare trajectory can be improved.

“Healthcare systems have a lot of data and yet they still have a hard time finding these patients, making it hard to respond proactively to patient care needs,” said Jason Pyle, CEO, BaseHealth. “Our system enables healthcare professionals to assess the unknown risk that exists within their patient population and provide access and critical care needed to both improve our overall population’s health and improve the individual patient’s experience with the healthcare system.”

HBM Healthcare Investments has a track-record of over 100 biopharma and healthcare investments that have resulted in significant value creation by more than 50 trade sales and IPOs since inception.

“We look for companies that are at an advanced stage of development, that are closely tracked and actively guided on their strategic direction. We see a lot of potential in the BaseHealth model in addressing improvements in patient care and controlling costs in the healthcare system,” said Dr. Andreas Wicki, CEO, HBM Healthcare Investments.
