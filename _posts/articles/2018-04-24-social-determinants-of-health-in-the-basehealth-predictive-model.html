description: 'More than ever before, the social determinants of health (SDOH) are

  individual’s relative health status. Here at BaseHealth, seeing as we’re in the
  business of predicting health status, we’ve focused significant time and effort
  on understanding how SDOH can be incorporated into our model. As such, we’ve developed
  a fairly nuanced view when it comes to the utility of SDOH in predicting health
  status. '
