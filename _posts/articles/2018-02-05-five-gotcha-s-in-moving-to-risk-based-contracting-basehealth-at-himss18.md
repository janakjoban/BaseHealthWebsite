description: 'BaseHealth will be in the HIMSS Solution Lab Pavilion, booth number
  14015. We do hope you will come say hello. This year, we will be showcasing two
  particular use cases for the BaseHealth predictive analytic engine: RAF revenue
  cycle optimization and interventional ROI. '
excerpt: 'Just like the rest of the health technology community, BaseHealth will be
  joining the crowds converging on Las Vegas the first week in March for HIMSS18.
  Any number of metaphors have been conjured to describe the massive event – a zoo,
  a circus, downright madness. All hold water, but no matter how the show is described,
  it remains an annual touchstone for the health tech community. It’s a time to come
  together, to see and be seen, and most importantly, to learn from old and new colleagues
  alike. '
