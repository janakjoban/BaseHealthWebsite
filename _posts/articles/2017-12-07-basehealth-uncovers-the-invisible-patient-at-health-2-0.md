**Santa Clara, California: Oct. 2, 2017** - [BaseHealth](http://www.basehealth.com/), the creator of the first predictive, evidence-based, and data-driven population health management solution, will demonstrate its analytic platform and highlight the concept of the [#InvisiblePatient](https://twitter.com/hashtag/InvisiblePatient?src=hash) at the [11th Annual Health 2.0 Fall Conference](http://health2con.com/) taking place this week in Santa Clara, Calif.

These strategic additions to the executive team build on recent momentum at the company.

### The Invisible Patient

In a demo session on [“Transforming Care & Insights Through Big Data & Analytics,”](https://fall2017.health2con.com/agenda/session/177628) BaseHealth CEO Jason Pyle will demonstrate how the BaseHealth platform leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to distill the data from millions of medical journals and patient studies and combine it with individual records to identify “Invisible Patients.”

“Invisible patients are the proverbial ‘needles in a haystack’ within a population. They are people who look healthy on paper, until they hit a tipping point, where they then face one adverse health event after another,” said Jason Pyle, CEO, BaseHealth. “With the right medical intervention at the right time, we can change their healthcare trajectory. That’s what we do at BaseHealth – find the invisible patients for healthcare professionals so they can intervene both to prevent diseases before they start and control them before it’s too late.”

At Health 2.0, BaseHealth is also launching an [#InvisiblePatient](https://twitter.com/hashtag/InvisiblePatient?src=hash) social media campaign, encouraging both show attendees and others following via social media, to show their support for the invisible patient by tagging a selfie or sharing a related story with the [#InvisiblePatient](https://twitter.com/hashtag/InvisiblePatient?src=hash) hashtag on Twitter or posting with the hashtag to the [BaseHealth Facebook page.](https://www.facebook.com/BasehealthInc/)
