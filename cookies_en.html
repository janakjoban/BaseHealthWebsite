        <h3>Does BaseHealth use cookies?</h3>
          <p>As described in Section 13 of our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/privacy-policy_en.html">Privacy Policy</a>, BaseHealth uses cookies and similar technologies like pixels and tags to give you a positive experience on our Websites: <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/">www.basehealth.com</a>, <a href="http://www.genophen.com/">www.genophen.com</a>.</p>

          <p>A cookie is a small file placed onto your device. Cookies enable us to identify your device, and enable the functioning of many features of our Websites including your ability to log into your account.</p>

          <p>If you do not want to receive cookies, you can change your browser settings. If you use our Websites without changing your browser settings, we will assume that you are happy to receive all cookies on the Websites. Please note that the Websites will not work properly without cookies.</p>

          <p>Trusted partners like analytics companies such as Google Analytics may also place cookies on your machine. Please read their privacy policies to ensure that you are comfortable with the manner in which they use cookies.</p>

        <h3>What types of cookies does BaseHealth use?</h3>
          <p>BaseHealth uses two types of cookies, persistent and session. A persistent cookie is set once you have logged in to your Genophen account. The next time you visit the Website using the same device, the persistent cookie will enable us to recognize you as an existing user, so you may not need to log in before using our services.</p>

          <p>A session cookie is used to identify a particular visit to our Websites. Session cookies expire after a short time, or when you close your web browser.</p>

          <p>Other technology, such as Adobe Flash, can be used to place the functional equivalent of a cookie on your computer.</p>

        <h3>When does BaseHealth put cookies on my device?</h3>
          <p>Cookies may be set by BaseHealth when you visit our Websites or they may be set by other websites or services who run content on the page you are viewing (known as third-party cookies).</p>

        <h3>What are cookies used for?</h3>
          <p>Cookies can be used to do lots of different things, like recognize you when you navigate to our Websites, storing your preferences and improving your experience. Cookies also make your interactions with BaseHealth more secure, faster, and help us to personalize your experience using our Websites and to conform to your settings. Additionally, cookies allow BaseHealth to bring you advertising both on and off our Websites, and bring customized features to you through plugins such as our share button.</p>

          <p>BaseHealth uses cookies for a number of purposes, including:</p>

          <p>Authentication – BaseHealth uses cookies to recognize you if you are logged in to BaseHealth so that we can show you the right information and personalize your experience.</p>

          <p>Security – BaseHealth uses cookies to support or enable security features we have deployed, and to help us detect malicious activity and violations of our Terms of Use.</p>

          <p>Preferences, features and services  – BaseHealth uses cookies to know which language you prefer, what your communications preferences are, and they help you fill out forms on Genophen. Plus they provide you with features, insights, and customized content through our plugins.</p>

          <p>Advertising – BaseHealth may use cookies to show you relevant advertising both on and off our Websites. We may also use a cookie to learn whether members who saw an ad on BaseHealth later visited the advertiser’s site. Similarly, our partners may use a cookie to determine whether we have shown an ad and how it performed, or provide us with information about how you interact with them. We may also work with a partner to show you an ad on or off Genophen, such as after you’ve visited a partner’s site or application. Cookies and ad technology such as web beacons, pixels, and anonymous ad network tags help BaseHealth more effectively serve ads to you, as well as to collect aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for advertisers. Note: Because your web browser may request advertisements and web beacons directly from ad network servers, these networks can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p>

          <p>Performance, Analytics and Research – BaseHealth uses cookies to help us learn how well our site and plugins perform across the globe. We also use cookies to understand, improve, and research products, features, and services, including when you access BaseHealth from other websites, applications, or devices such as your work computer or your mobile device.</p>

          <p>Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. Limiting the ability of websites to set cookies, however, may worsen your overall user experience.</p>
